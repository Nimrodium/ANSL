# Introduction
  ansl is a basic, high level language explicitely for the NISVC architecture
  ansl stands for advanced nisvc system language.
  its syntax is similar to rust, but the behavior more closely aligns to C.
  it is a very simple language, manual memory management, it gives nisvc a more human friendly syntax.

  the offical compiler compiles into nsm text files, which are then passed to the assembler.

  introduce variables using let
  introduce constant variables with const
  introduce static variables with static
  introduce functions with fn
  declare types with :
  scopes are defined with curly brackets
  arrays are defined with brackets
  tuples and functions use parentheseses
